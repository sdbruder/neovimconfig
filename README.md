# ðŸ’¤ Bruder LazyVim config

Based on the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) if you want to modify it.

Some simple changes to the config:
- revert `Y` to standard vim behaviour
- Tab / Shift-Tab to change between buffers / tabs
- Shift-arrows to move between panes
- turn off relative line numbering
